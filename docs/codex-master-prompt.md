# Codex Master Prompt

You are my coding agent.

Build a production-style Multi-Tenant SaaS Subscription & Billing
Platform in C# using .NET 8.

Rules: - Use Clean Architecture: Api / Application / Domain /
Infrastructure / Worker. - Use PostgreSQL with EF Core. - Use Stripe
(test mode) + webhook handling with idempotency. - Use Hangfire for
background jobs. - Use Serilog for structured logging with correlation
IDs. - Use JWT authentication. - Provide Docker Compose for API +
Worker + Postgres + Redis. - Every phase must include: - Code changes -
EF migrations - How to test the feature - No placeholder core logic. -
Keep it realistic but not overengineered.
